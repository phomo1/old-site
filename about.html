			<h2><b>About us</b></h2>

<p text-align="justify">The Philosophy of Memory Organization (PhOMO) is an international network that aims to foster interaction among philosophers interested in the study of memory and its relationship to other cognitive phenomena and philosophical issues.<br />
<br />
PhOMO was founded at the Issues in Philosophy of Memory conference held in 2017 in Cologne. Issues in Philosophy of Memory 2 will be held in 2019 in Rome, and the intention is for future conferences to continue to be held on a biennial basis.
