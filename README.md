* /js folder contains the JS for the responsive navbar;

* /includes contains the header.html for the site;

* /imgs contains the imgs for the pages;

NOTE: the image (us.JPG) in the index.html file must be at the main folder (outside of /imgs). For some reason, it won't load properly if it's inside a subfolder.

* All the html pages must be on the main folder. If they are moved to a subfolder, the responsive navbar will not work.
